1. Differentiate Flowchart & Algorithm.

  - The two types of tools used for developing new programs, particularly in computer programming, are algorithms and flowcharts.
  A flowchart depicts the phases of a program in a graphical manner, whereas an algorithm provides a step-by-step examination of the process.
  
2. Discuss the brief history of flowchart.
  
  - Frank and Lillian Gilbreth, industrial engineers, presented the "Flow Process Chart" to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1921. (ASME). 
  Gilbreth's tools were utilized by industrial engineer Allan H. Morgensen to provide conferences on increasing productivity to businesspeople at his company 
  in the early 1930s.
